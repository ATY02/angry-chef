gemini.py - chat.send_message tells the Gemini AI how to act
main.py - Chatterbot QnA format
App.jsx - where to put visible emotions

Gemini - can tell it how to act
Chatterbot - based on our input

UX improvements: make Gemini and Chatterbot look like tabs
    make sure visible emotion Gordon goes under chat if there is no space on left side
    dark/lightmode state stays between tabs

In main.py, make Gordon answers less obviously made by AI.
    In other words, actually good insults.
